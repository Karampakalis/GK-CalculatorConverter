Simple Calculator/Currency Converter 
Desquared Assignment December 2023

The purpose of this assignment is the implementation of a simple (not scientific) calculator app with the ability to convert a given amount between different currencies using any public API like 
http://fixer.io/, which I used. The app was developed using Android Studio.

The application consists of two activities:

a) The **MainActivity** is the commencing activity, where the Calculator exists. The user can perform mathematical operations (division, multiplication, addition, substraction), as well as find the percentage of a number. Also, there are additional options, such as the option to clear the result of an operation (C), to clear the result and the operations (AC) and to delete the last written character.

b) The **ConverterActivity**, which lets the user choose between many different currencies and convert any amount between two of them. There also is the "Change" options, which lets the user change between his/hers FROM and TO values with a click.
